# 2-Player Math Game - Ruby

A simple command-line based 2-Player Math Game built with Ruby, where players take turns to answer simple math addition problems. 

Each player starts with 3 lives and loses a life if they mis-answer a question. 

The game continues until one of the players loses all their lives. The player with lives remaining at the end of the game wins.

Math game can be run by ```ruby main.rb``` in terminal.
